Hi! I'm Keisuke!
I'm third grade of university.
I'm interested in anti-aging and programming.
Recently, I've been learning Python and English.
Speaking of certification, I only have 825 score on TOEIC.
Since I started leaning programming from this year and don't have my own work yet, I'll do learn programming hard!
